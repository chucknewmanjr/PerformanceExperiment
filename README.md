# Performance Experiment

Try to make this run faster. Requires SQL Server 2019 (V15). To test it, run this script. (Takes a couple minutes.) And then run the following statement in 5 query windows so that they all run at the same time. (Takes a minute.)

		use [PerformanceExperiment];
		exec [dbo].[p_RunProcessMessages];

Once they're all done, run the following to check the results.

		use [PerformanceExperiment];
		exec [dbo].[p_PerformanceReport];

## Chalenge
After that, make some improvements and repeat the process.
